The code consists of an entire multimodal rag pipeline. The rag pipeline extracts data from the uploaded pdf(images,text) and then stores it in the vector database(chromadb in this case.)
Further more the model is created using API and that model can be used for Q/A systems retrieving relevant information from the vector database.
